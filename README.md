# Scientific Rebuttal: Zacharias (2026) & the ECDO Theory

## If ECDO has you losing sleep, start here. You're okay.

This repository contains a scientific rebuttal of Zacharias (2026a, 2026b) — "Critical Degradation of Earth's Rotational Coupling" and "Systematic Directional Forcing of Earth's Rotation Pole Toward ~75°W" — which serve as the claimed data support for the ECDO (Exothermic Core-Mantle Decoupling) earth flip theory.

## Key Findings

- **Total wobble declined 21-35%, not 98%.** Six independent filter-free methods agree.
- **The annual wobble INCREASED ~32%.** The author claims it collapsed 97%. His narrow Butterworth filter lost the signal.
- **Chandler wobble declined ~70%, not 99%.** Real and interesting, but not unprecedented — deep minima occurred in the 1920s and 1940s.
- **The "hook" analysis detects standard GIA drift, not LLSVPs.** A synthetic planet with no LLSVPs produces a *higher* hook rate than real Earth.
- **The r = 0.97 correlation is spurious.** Random declining series produce r = 0.99. First-differencing eliminates it.
- **The ECDO "flip" is physically impossible.** It requires 4 quadrillion Hiroshima bombs of energy with no identified source, and the D″ layer friction alone would generate 2,700× the Sun's energy output.

- **Appendix A** (inside the PDF) — Complete Python replication code using publicly available IERS C04 data

## Transparency

This rebuttal was written with the assistance of Claude AI (Anthropic). All findings were independently corroborated using Gemini and Grok. Full replication code is provided — anyone can verify these results using freely available IERS data.

## No other scientist on Earth has detected a catastrophe

If core-mantle coupling had collapsed 98%, every geodesist, GPS network, VLBI baseline, and space agency on Earth would know. None of them see it because it isn't happening.

**There is no basis for public alarm.** A ~70% Chandler decline and ~30% total wobble reduction are scientifically interesting. They are not evidence of catastrophic failure or any threat to civilization.
